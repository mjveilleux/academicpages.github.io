I am an American postgraduate student at the University of Kentâ€™s School of Economics. My studies and interests center around aspects of economic development in low- and middle-income countries. I have both lived and work experience in Mexico, Honduras, and Colombia and am skilled in various econometric and statistical methods. 

Previously, I earned a BA Spanish and MA Global Affairs from the University of Oklahoma. While there I studied Latin American politics, history, and literature. I also spent a semester studying in Mexico at UPAEP where I studied Mexican history and literature. Before my studies, I worked in construction for two years in my native state, California.

Upon graduation, I hope to begin a career in economic development. In the meantime, this website will house my CV, a blog, and a portfolio of R script and visualizations for future employers to check out. If you wish to reach out, please feel open to emailing me at mv308@kent.ac.uk
